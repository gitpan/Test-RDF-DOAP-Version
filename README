NAME
    Test::RDF::DOAP::Version - tests 'meta/changes.ttl' is up to date

DESCRIPTION
    "doap_version_ok($dist, $module)"
        Checks the distribution metadata matches the pattern:

                ?dist doap:release ?rel .
                ?rel doap:revision ?ver .

        Where ?dist is the URI
        "http://purl.org/NET/cpan-uri/dist/%s/project" (%s having been
        substituted for $dist) and ?ver is the $VERSION from $module, as an
        xsd:string or plain literal.
