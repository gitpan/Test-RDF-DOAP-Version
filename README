NAME
    Test::RDF::DOAP::Version - tests 'meta/changes.ttl' is up to date

DESCRIPTION
    "doap_version_ok($dist, $module)"
        Reads all RDF in a distribution's "meta" directory and checks the
        distribution metadata matches the pattern:

                ?uri doap:release ?rel .
                ?rel doap:revision ?ver .

        Where ?uri is the URI
        "http://purl.org/NET/cpan-uri/dist/$dist/project" and ?ver is
        "$module->VERSION", as an xsd:string or plain literal.
